I made something in github yay. Thank you so much to magi for helping me get started with this, I couldn't have done it without him.

If you haven't found out by now, this is a puzzle. If you know anything about HTML then you should be able to solve it almost immedeately,
it's mostly designed for people who don't know coding though so if you want the most entertaining experience, solve it without looking through the code.

Have fun!
